## Resubmission
This is a second resubmission. In this version I have:
* Removed Rd files for unexported functions, therefore all Rd files contains examples. Description of unexported functions has remained in r files.

In the first resubmission, I had:
* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 Pro, R 3.5.2
* checked by travis-ci, R 3.2.4

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Comment
This is the first version of this package.
